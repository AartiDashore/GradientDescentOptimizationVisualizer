# Gradient Descent Optimization Visualization

## Description

This project demonstrates the **Gradient Descent** optimization algorithm on a simple 2D function, specifically the quadratic function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). The gradient descent algorithm is used to find the minimum of this function, and the optimization process is visualized through a contour plot showing the path taken by the algorithm. The project provides a visual representation of how gradient descent converges to the minimum point.

## Features

- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Implements gradient descent to minimize the quadratic function.
- **Contour Plot Visualization**: Shows the surface of the function and the path of the algorithm as it converges to the minimum.
- **Adjustable Learning Rate**: Modify the step size for gradient descent to see its effect on the optimization process.
- **Convergence Path**: Visualizes the steps taken by the algorithm towards the minimum.

## Libraries

- `numpy`: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating the contour plot and visualizing the gradient descent process.

### Installation

To run the code, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## How It Works

### 1. Define the Function to Minimize

The function used for this project is a simple quadratic function of two variables \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \). This function has a global minimum at the point \( (0, 0) \), and the goal of gradient descent is to converge to this minimum.

```python
def function(x, y):
    return x**2 + y**2
```

- **`x, y`**: These are the variables of the function.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the value of \( f(x, y) \), which is used to evaluate the performance of gradient descent at each step.

### 2. Compute the Gradient

The gradient is the vector of partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable. For \( f(x, y) \), the gradient is given by \( \nabla f(x, y) = [2x, 2y] \).

```python
def gradient(x, y):
    return np.array([2*x, 2*y])
```

- **`x, y`**: Input variables.
- **Return Value**: A NumPy array representing the gradient of the function at point \( (x, y) \), which shows the direction of the steepest ascent. In gradient descent, we move in the opposite direction to minimize the function.

### 3. Gradient Descent Algorithm

The gradient descent algorithm iteratively updates the current point based on the gradient and the learning rate. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations.

```python
def gradient_descent(learning_rate, n_iterations, initial_point):
    points = [initial_point]  # Stores the path taken by the algorithm
    current_point = np.array(initial_point)
    
    for i in range(n_iterations):
        grad = gradient(current_point[0], current_point[1])
        next_point = current_point - learning_rate * grad  # Update rule
        points.append(next_point)
        current_point = next_point
    
    return np.array(points)
```

- **`learning_rate`**: Controls the step size of the updates. A smaller learning rate means smaller steps, while a larger learning rate may lead to larger steps but risks overshooting the minimum.
- **`n_iterations`**: The number of iterations (steps) the algorithm takes to converge towards the minimum.
- **`initial_point`**: The starting point for the gradient descent algorithm.
- **`points`**: A list of all the points visited by the algorithm during the optimization process.
- **`current_point`**: The current position of the algorithm, updated in each iteration by subtracting the gradient scaled by the learning rate.
- **Return Value**: The function returns a NumPy array of all points visited by the algorithm, which will be used to visualize the optimization path.

### 4. Visualization of Gradient Descent Path

The contour plot of the function is generated using `matplotlib`, and the path taken by the gradient descent algorithm is plotted on top of the contour plot to visualize the optimization process.

```python
def plot_gradient_descent(points, learning_rate):
    x_values = np.linspace(-5, 5, 400)
    y_values = np.linspace(-5, 5, 400)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x_values, y_values)
    Z = function(X, Y)

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

    # Contour plot of the function
    plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=np.logspace(0, 3, 35), cmap='viridis')

    # Plot the path of gradient descent
    plt.plot(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], 'ro-', markersize=5, lw=2, label="Gradient Descent Path")

    # Mark the starting point
    plt.plot(points[0, 0], points[0, 1], 'bo', label="Start", markersize=10)

    # Mark the final point (minima)
    plt.plot(points[-1, 0], points[-1, 1], 'go', label="Convergence", markersize=10)

    plt.title(f"Gradient Descent Optimization (Learning Rate = {learning_rate})")
    plt.xlabel("X")
    plt.ylabel("Y")
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
```

- **`x_values, y_values`**: Arrays representing a grid of points over the 2D plane where the function is defined. These points are used to create the contour plot.
- **`X, Y`**: The meshgrid created from `x_values` and `y_values` to evaluate the function over the 2D plane.
- **`Z`**: The values of the function evaluated at each point on the grid.
- **`points`**: The path taken by the gradient descent algorithm, which is plotted as a red line.
- **`'ro-'`**: Specifies that the path should be plotted as a red line with circle markers.
- **`markersize=5, lw=2`**: Specifies the size of the markers and the width of the line for the gradient descent path.
- **`label="Gradient Descent Path"`**: Provides a label for the path in the legend.

### 5. Parameters and Execution

- **`learning_rate`**: The step size used in each iteration of gradient descent. It can be adjusted to see its effect on the convergence speed and accuracy.
- **`n_iterations`**: The total number of iterations (steps) the gradient descent algorithm performs.
- **`initial_point`**: The starting point for the algorithm. It can be any arbitrary point in the 2D space.

```python
# Parameters
learning_rate = 0.1  # Step size
n_iterations = 30  # Number of iterations
initial_point = [4.0, 4.0]  # Starting point for gradient descent

# Run Gradient Descent
points = gradient_descent(learning_rate, n_iterations, initial_point)

# Plot the optimization path
plot_gradient_descent(points, learning_rate)
```

### Key Variables Explanation

- **`learning_rate`**: Determines how large each step should be in the direction of the negative gradient. A smaller value makes convergence slower but safer, while a larger value can speed up convergence but risks overshooting the minimum.
- **`n_iterations`**: The number of iterations the algorithm will run. More iterations allow the algorithm to converge more accurately.
- **`initial_point`**: The point at which gradient descent starts its optimization process. The closer it is to the minimum, the faster it converges.
- **`points`**: An array containing all the points visited by the algorithm during optimization. It is used to visualize the path taken by gradient descent.

## Output

- **Contour Plot**: A contour plot of the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \), showing the surface of the function.
- **Gradient Descent Path**: The path taken by the gradient descent algorithm is plotted on top of the contour plot. The algorithm starts from the initial point (marked in blue) and converges towards the minimum (marked in green).
